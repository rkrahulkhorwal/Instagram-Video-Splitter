# Instagram-Video-Splitter
This Python script takes a long video file and splits it into multiple 30-second clips suitable for Instagram posts. It also adds a custom caption to each clip, fits the video into a 9:16 aspect ratio (1080x1920 pixels), and ensures the entire original video content is visible.
